### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
 <a style="z-index: 3;" href="./Page2.html" > <img class="pap" id="pap" src="./images/icon-paper.svg"> </a>
```
```css
.sci2 .show {
    visibility: visible;
    -webkit-animation: fadeIn 1s;
    animation: fadeIn 1s
  }
```
```js
function func() {
  let pap2= document.getElementById("pap2");
  pap2.classList.toggle("show");
}
```


### Continued development

I wanna continue to train myself on mobil first developpement and javascript in general.

## Acknowledgments


My best advice its : work mobile first ! I din't do that in my first version and I had to work a lot to make my website suitable for phone. 

Don't hesitate to ask about the animations for the rules display part.

I personally added some small details (highlighting of the buttons when hovering over them). This makes the site more lively and personalizes it a bit. I think it's a good thing.
